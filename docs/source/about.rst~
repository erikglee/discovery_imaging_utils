About
=====

This package was developed primarily to assist in the analysis of resting-state fMRI data that has been preprocessed with fMRIPREP. The utilities inside provide mechanisms for denoising the resting-state data, calculating functional connectivity properties, and visualizing data. In general the package is under very active development and may undergo large changes between releases. Please use with caution.
