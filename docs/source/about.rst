About
=====

This is a package made to assist in the analysis of resting-state fMRI data, particularly fMRI data preprocessed with fMRIPREP. The utilities inside provide mechanisms for denoising the resting-state data, calculating functional connectivity properties, visualizing data, etc. 

*In general the package is under very active development and may undergo large changes between releases. Please use with caution.*
