Installation
============

Discovery Imaging Utils is most easily available on PyPi. The package can be installed from pip as follows::

   pip install discovery-imaging-utils

Alternatively, if the user does not have root privileges::

   pip install discovery-imaging-utils --user

The above commands do not install the dependencies present in discovery-imaging-utils. To install these dependencies, navigate to the *requirements.txt* file in the package directory and run the following::

   pip install -r requirements.txt

Similarly, add *--user* to this command if you do not have sudo privelages.

This package was developed in Python3.6 and has not been tested in other versions of Python.
